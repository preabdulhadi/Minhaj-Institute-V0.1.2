LOGO SETUP INSTRUCTIONS
========================

To use your logo on the website:

1. Place your "Logo 1.png" file in this public/ folder
2. Make sure the file is named exactly "Logo 1.png" (with a space)
3. The logo will automatically appear in the navigation bar
4. Recommended logo dimensions: 200-300px wide, transparent background works best

The navbar is configured to:
- Display your logo at 64px height (h-16)
- Automatically scale width to maintain aspect ratio
- Show a fallback text if the logo is not found

Current logo path: /Logo 1.png
